Using the included assets, code an email that is 640px wide on desktop and changes to Mobile view layout when viewed in a device which screen is 450px wide or less. Provide the finished email as an HTML file and include the assets used.

On Desktop view, it has a 1-column Top Section, a 2-column Middle Section and a 2-column Bottom Section

The Top Section 
===============
Use the following layout in this order:

Top Header
TopImage
Top subhead
Top linked button

Use a grey background and black text
On Desktop and Mobile is 100% the width of the email

Should use different images for Desktop and Mobile devices.
Desktop image should be centered and displayed at 576px wide
The Mobile image should be centered and 90% of the email width

For the linked button, use "Click here" as copy AND use rounded corners that work on all devices and email clients.
Use white text and green background for the linked button



The Middle Section
==================
Use a white background and black text
On Desktop, is 90% the width of the email
On Mobile instead of 90% of the email width, it has a 20px padding left and right

Use this layout for Desktop view:

Image1	Image2
Text1	Text2

Image3	Image4
Text3	Text4

Image5	Image6
Text5	Text6


Mobile view should render like this:

Image2
Text2

Image1
Text1

Image4
Text2

Image3
Text1

Image6
Text2

Image5
Text1


The Bottom Section
================== 
Use a black background and white text
On Desktop, is 90% the width of the email
On Mobile instead of 90% of the email width, it has a 20px padding left and right


Use this layout for Desktop view:

BottomImage	BottomText 


Mobile view should render like this:

BottomImage	
BottomText 

For BottomText, use 3 lines of copy that have hard breaks at their end AND remove the line breaks when the email is viewed on a Mobile device so the copy wraps, without line breaks,  in the available space as needed

Have fun!
